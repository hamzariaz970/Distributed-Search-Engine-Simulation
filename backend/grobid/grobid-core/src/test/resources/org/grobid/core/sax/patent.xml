    <p n="0003" xml:id="_2ff0350035">A cadherin is a super family of the trans-membrane glycoprotein which controls the cell adhesion between generation|occurrence|production and a structure|tissue homeostasis (Gumbiner, J.Cell.Biol., 148:399-404(2000);Yagi et al., Genes Dev., 14:1169-1180(2000)).<lb>
        </lb>The intracellular domain of a cadherin is interacted with cytoplasm proteins, such as a catenin and p120, and the foundation of a coupling|bonding with a cadherin and an actin cytoskeleton is formed of it.<lb>
        </lb>A cadherin has five extracellular Ca&lt;2+&gt; binding domains and the small cytosolic domain highly preserve|saved between classic cadherins.<lb>
        </lb>P-cadherin, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin is contained in the component of a classic cadherin family.<lb>
        </lb>It is thought that cell adhesion molecules, such as a cadherin, play the serious|significant role for the cell junction of a cancer cell and a transfer cell (Furukawa et al., Microscopy Res.Technique, 38(4):343-352(1997)).<lb>
        </lb>P-cadherin expression in a normal adult tissue is low, and is restrict|limited mainly to the base layer of a myoepithelial cell and the stratified epithelium (Shimoyama et al., Cancer Res., 49:2128-33(1989)).<lb>
        </lb>P-cadherin is upregulated by inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease and colitis (Hardy et al., Gut, 50:513-519(2002)).<lb>
        </lb>It is clear from a series of extensive proof now that abnormal P-cadherin expression is also related to the tumor of cell growth, the colon, a breast, a lung, a thyroid gland, and a uterine cervix (Gamallo, Modern Pathology, 14:650-654 (2001);, Stefansson et al., J.Clin.Oncol.,<lb>
        </lb>22 (7) :1242-1252 (2004)).<lb>
        </lb>It was reported that antigen recognition of the human P-cadherin is carried out by the NCC-CAD-299 monoclonal antibody produced with respect to the vulva epidermoid carcinoma (Shimoyama et al., Cancer Res., 49:2128-2133(1989)).<lb>
        </lb>When the adhesion|attachment and intracellular signal transduction which P-cadherin carries are adjusted, it will estimate|forecast that the proliferation and survival of the tumor cells in in vivo fall.</p>
    <head xml:id="_2ff0350046">PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION</head>
    <p n="0004" xml:id="_2ff0350047">Therefore, when the central role considered that P-cadherin has in cell growth and advancing of a solid tumor is considered, it is desirable to produce|generate the antibody with respect to P-cadherin which can bring the patient of various cancers remedial profits.</p>
